# Standardized Difference Calculation

The following code aims at implementing the approach for calculating the standarised difference for continuous and categorical variable by Dongsheng, Y. and Dalton, E. (2012) into python.

As example, we use the Iris dataset and calculate the standardized difference on both categorical and numerical variables. For that we simulate a binary treatment and control flag. 

The results from the SAS code ara available by [**clicking here**](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/josecaloca/standardised_difference/blob/master/results%20SAS.htm)

Final results for comaparison are allocated in the notebook [**standardised_difference**](https://github.com/josecaloca/standardised_difference/blob/master/standardised_difference.ipynb)
